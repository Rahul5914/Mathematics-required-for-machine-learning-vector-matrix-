🔍 Introduction
Mathematics plays a critical role in Machine Learning, as ML models rely on mathematical concepts for data representation, transformations, and optimizations. The three main topics covered in this repository are:
✔️ Vectors – Fundamental building blocks for ML models
✔️ Matrices – Used for representing datasets and transformations
✔️ Operations on Matrices – Essential for computations in ML algorithms

This repository provides theoretical explanations and Python code implementations to help you understand and apply these concepts in ML projects.

🛠 Prerequisites
Before diving in, you should have:
✅ Basic knowledge of Python 🐍
✅ Familiarity with NumPy (recommended but not mandatory)
✅ Interest in Mathematics & Machine Learning 🤖

📌 Vectors in Machine Learning
A vector is a one-dimensional array that represents data points in ML. Vectors are used in:

Feature representation (e.g., a dataset of house prices, where each house has multiple features)

Gradient Descent (used for optimizing ML models)

Distance calculations (e.g., Euclidean distance in KNN)

Vector Operations
1️⃣ Addition & Subtraction
2️⃣ Dot Product
3️⃣ Magnitude & Norm
4️⃣ Projection

🔹 Example:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np  

# Define vectors
v1 = np.array([2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 1])

# Vector addition
v_add = v1 + v2  

# Dot product
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)

print("Vector Addition:", v_add)
print("Dot Product:", dot_product)
📌 Matrices and Their Role
A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. In ML, matrices are used for:

Representing datasets (each row is a data point, each column is a feature)

Transformations in Deep Learning (e.g., weights in Neural Networks)

Linear Regression & Optimization (matrices help solve equations efficiently)

Matrix Operations
1️⃣ Addition & Subtraction
2️⃣ Multiplication (Dot Product)
3️⃣ Transpose of a Matrix
4️⃣ Inverse of a Matrix
5️⃣ Determinant of a Matrix

🔹 Example:

python
Copy
Edit
# Define matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Matrix addition
C = A + B

# Matrix multiplication
D = np.dot(A, B)

# Transpose
A_T = A.T

print("Matrix Addition:\n", C)
print("Matrix Multiplication:\n", D)
print("Transpose of A:\n", A_T)
📌 Working with Matrices in Python
Python provides powerful libraries like NumPy to handle matrix operations efficiently.
Here are some commonly used operations:

🔹 Creating a Matrix

python
Copy
Edit
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Matrix:\n", matrix)
🔹 Identity Matrix

python
Copy
Edit
I = np.eye(3)
print("Identity Matrix:\n", I)
🔹 Inverse of a Matrix

python
Copy
Edit
A = np.array([[3, 4], [2, 5]])
A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)
print("Inverse of A:\n", A_inv)
🔹 Determinant of a Matrix

python
Copy
Edit
det = np.linalg.det(A)
print("Determinant of A:", det)
